    <p>Since <strong>Q2 2014</strong> you can easily bind <strong>RadGrid</strong> on the client via the <strong>RadClientDataSource</strong> control. The functionality is provided out of the box through the server-side <strong>ClientDataSourceID</strong> property which also has its client-side counterpart - the <strong>set_clientDataSourceID()</strong> method. 	</p>
    <p>Client-side data binding means fewer postbacks, easier integration with various data services and a more flexible client-side development. 	</p>
    Sorting and filtering can be performed automatically when <strong>RadClientDataSource</strong> is used. If you need to use sorting or filtering, simply set the <span><strong>AllowSorting</strong></span> and <span><strong>AllowFilteringByColumn</strong></span> properties of <strong>RadGrid</strong> to <strong>true</strong>. 
    <p>RadGrid also supports <strong>Batch Editing</strong> when bound on the client and to enable it, you only need to set <strong>EditMode</strong> to <strong>Batch</strong>. 	</p>
    <p>In this demo you will see how to bind the grid to a WCF service. The key points of interest are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span>The <strong>OnDataParse</strong></span> event <span>&nbsp;handler passes the data returned from the service</span></li>
        <li>The <span><strong>OnCustomParameter</strong></span> handler <span>sends the data in the correct format</span> to the service.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Schema model</strong> of the <strong>RadClientDataSource</strong> is defined which includes all fields and the ID of the table. 		</li>
    </ul>
